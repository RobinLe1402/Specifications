1. General

   1.1. Purpose

      The purpose of this specification is to define <...>

   1.2. Intended audience
   
      This specification is intended for use by implementors of software
      to <...>

      The text of the specification assumes a basic background in
      programming at the level of bits and other primitive data
      representations.

   1.3. <...>

      <...>

   1.4 Definitions of terms and conventions used
   
      Byte: 8 bits stored as a unit. Also called an octet.
      For this specification, a byte is exactly 8 bits, even on machines
      which store a character on a number of bits different from eight.
